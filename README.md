The Delineo Simulator attempts to realistically capture the mechanisms of disease spread within a diverse range of 
geographies, ranging from small rural communities to large cities. The simulator works in two parts. Fundamentally, 
the question of disease movement is a question of population movement. Using geolocation mobility data from SafeGraph,
realistic population movement dynamics are created. Then, a statistical disease driver uses the population movement 
information to predict disease spread.
